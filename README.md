## Awesome Life Suggestions üôåüèΩ

This repository is an attempt to compile a list of actions that improves the quality of life.

The list is inspired by the list James Clear authored in [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). While the list may seem obvious, you'd be surprised to learn how many adults grow up unprepared for life. That's partly because the human brain tries to do everything its asked using autopilot. Our brains are excellent at fooling us and we're quick to overestimate our knowledge (see [The Dunning Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning‚ÄìKruger_effect)). As Donald Rumsfeld said, we have known unknown (the things you know you don't know), but there are are also *unknown* unknowns (things you don't know you don't know) ü§Ø.  

Nobel Prize winner Psychologist [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman) in his book [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) writes that our brains are lazy and have learned to conserve energy. Most of the things we know today are things we learned in school, or from our parents or other people. This means your knowledge is limited to what you‚Äôve already learned or seen. How do you get new unbiased information?

News and social media, which are the primary sources for knowledge for most people today, don‚Äôt offer objective advice. Moreover, trust is harder to establish on the internet. The miracle drug with 5-star ratings could be just ill-tasting sugar syrup with fake reviews.

This repository aims to share ‚Äú*Life Pro Tips*‚Äù that often get overlooked. 

## Steps to improve your life


**Nutrition**


- Buy a water filter to clean your drinking water. Avoid paying for bottled water. 
- Drink enough water to prevent dehydration, which can lead to serious health issues later in life. 
- Buy smaller plates to eat less. 
- Eat freshly cooked food. 
- Avoid junk as much as possible. If MickeyDees is your weakness, track your visits and set a goal to reduce over time. 
- Ask your doctor if you should take Vitamin D. 

**Sleep**


- Buy the best mattress and pillow you can afford. Doctors recommend 7-8 hours of sleep every night. That‚Äôs 33% of your life!
- Don‚Äôt put your bed and TV in the same room. If you only have one room then, consider eliminating the TV. 
- Get blackout curtains. 
- Try a white noise machine for better sleep. You can also use an old radio or your phone.
	- On MacOS, you can use `play` to generate white noise. I use this in combination with Alfred. 
		- `/opt/homebrew/bin/play -n synth 180:00 whitenoise` 
- Chamomile tea and Valerian root help improve sleep.
- Maintain a strict sleep schedule. 
- Read [Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker, PhD](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316)
- Avoid breathing through your nose when sleeping. Use tape to keep your mouth closed. 

**Productivity**


- Unsubscribe from emails
- Turn off notifications and mute group chats
- Set your phone on silent
- Use filters, keep marketing out of your inbox
- Don‚Äôt install apps that let you *kill ~~productivity~~ time*

**Happiness**


- Get a pet (May not be for everyone. Only get a pet if you have the time to dedicate to your pet‚Äôs upbringing).
- Move to a friendly neighborhood.
- Love your family but don‚Äôt let anyone manipulate you into doing something against your will
- Do not let make others make life choices for you
- Invest in your happiness by seeking methods like mindfulness that are proven to improve mental health.  
- Don‚Äôt compare yourself with others. Aggressively compare yourself with yourself from the past.
- Maintain a gratitude journal.  

**General Health**


- Get vaccinated
- Brush 2x a day and floss every night. Dental health is more important than many of us think. Poor dental hygiene leads to a myriad of issues later in life. Prevent diseases like diabetes and heart conditions by making sure your teeth are clean before you snooze. 
- Avoid using screens at least 30 minutes before going to bed. If you cannot avoid screens like me, avoid social media. I recommend reading a physical book before going to bed, you‚Äôll have a much relaxing sleep. 
- Good shoes prevent backache. Seriously, you may think that it‚Äôs your chair or posture or something else, but bad ill-fitting shoes often go undetected. 
- Invest in a good chair and desk
- Engage in physical activities that elevate your heart rate above 120bpm for at least 150 minutes a week. 
- Avoid breathing through your mouth. Breathing through mouth can lead to diseases later in life. As long as your nose still hangs over your lips, try sucking in air through those tubes instead of the mouth. 

**Finance**


- Invest regularly. Try to follow the 70/30 rule for investing. 
- Set up automatic bill pay. Never pay late charges! You are already paying too much. If a company charges you late fee, kindly request them waive it off in favor of automatic bill payment. Customer service people are often incentivized to enroll customers in automatic bill pay. 
- Whenever buying something, ask for a discount. You‚Äôd be surprised how many times businesses will happily give you a discount to have you as a repeat customer.
- Buy life insurance and keep the payments current. You don‚Äôt want to leave your dependents with no financial support due to a missed insurance payment. Believe it or not, insurance policies lapse when one or more payments are not received by the due date. 
- Insure your home, auto, etc. Basically, anything that Geico commercials sell.
- ~~Cut cable~~ Throw your TV out and put up a nice bookshelf instead, and start building a library of books that will improve your life üòä
